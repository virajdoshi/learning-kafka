Kafka is distributed event streaming platform that used publish and subscribe mechanism to stream the records.
    - distributed -> It means we distribute the entity by breaking it into multiple sub entitiy and store into multiple locations.
                     Or we can store that full entitiy into multiple locations it is known as replication.
                     Both methods are configurable.
